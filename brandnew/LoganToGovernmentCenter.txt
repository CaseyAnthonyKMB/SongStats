Consider this a letter that I never sent  However inconsiderate it seems    consider me the boy you laughed with      I know you waited  t get me on the phone  t make me not alone    re looking surprised  re what makes New England so great  My island nights are all spent dying    my wishful thinking  t get me on the phone  t make me not alone    re a blue eyed lightning bolt    m a national phenomenon          So let my hands stray past that boundaries of your back      t get me t get me on the phone    re a blue eyed lightning bolt    m a national phenomenon     Jesse Lacey
