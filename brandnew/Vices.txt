Those days are dead Those days are dead Those days are dead We need vices at fifty thousand degrees She said goodbye to the ground She said goodbye to the ground She said goodbye to the ground And jumped My mind eraser And that forest burned That forest burned That forest burned  so we can return She said goodbye to the ground She said goodbye to the ground She said goodbye to the ground She said goodbye to the ground She said goodbye to the ground And jumped ve done nothing but brandish our disguises Those days are dead Those days are dead Those days are dead We need vices to wave to the good old days She said goodbye to the ground She said goodbye to the ground She said goodbye to the ground  Jesse Lacey
