d arrest you if I had handcuffs d arrest you if I had the time d throw you down in the backseat As if you committed a terrible crime We break into towns worth of houses And rob whole families blind d do it to you like you do it to me If I knew you would get away fine d drown all these crying babies t cry d squeeze real soft And let a piece of myself die s hard to be the better man re trying s hard to be the better man d arrest you if I had handcuffs d arrest you if I had the time As all of your appeals were declined d drive my car off of the bridge t inside  who could ask for more A fantastic way to kill some time If you could lay on your back and be beaten You could put up your fists and fight s hard to be the better man re trying s hard to be the better man re still lying s hard to be the better man re trying s hard to be the better man re still lying  Vincent Accardi
