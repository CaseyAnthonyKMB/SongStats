I think this staying up is exactly what I need Well take apart your head  and the flock it has bred ll push you up Right against the wall Chew it up and swallow it re running ll find sleep in the end tonight t shake this little feeling ll never get anything right t own up to anything Then you think you will inspire Take apart your head re running ll find sleep in the end tonight t shake this little feeling ll never say anything right  never say anything right  never say anything right  never say anything right  never say anything right  take me back to your bed I love you so much that it hurts my head t mind you under my skin  the bad parts in When we were made we were set apart Life is a test and I get bad marks Now some saint got the job of writing down my sins  the storm is coming in re running ll find sleep in the end tonight t shake this little feeling ll never get anything right  never say anything right  never say anything right  take me back to your bed I love you so much that it hurts my head t mind you under my skin  the bad parts in re my favourite bird and when you sing d wear my ring  I am still the king  Garrett Tierney
