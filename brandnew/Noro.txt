Little light lead us through the night And if we die burn down the forest  carry us t care to walk m on my way to hell m on my way to hell m on my way to hell m on my way to hell Sitting duck Running out of luck s stuck on a train crossing How are we ever gonna know peace How will I ever see your light through the trees I wanna burn down everything we begun I wanna kill and eat my young m on my way to hell m on my way to hell m on my way to hell m on my way to hell  Vincent Accardi
