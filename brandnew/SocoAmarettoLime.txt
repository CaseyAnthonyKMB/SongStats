Passed out on the overpass  Sunday best and broken glass  Broken down from the bikes and bars  Suspended like spirits over speeding cars  You and me were kings over the parkway tonight  And tonight will go on forever while we  walk around this town like we own the streets  and stay awake through summer like we own the heat      And when I pass the bottle back to Pete   I bet we laugh            re the coolest kids and we take what we can get The hell out of this town  Find some conversation  The low fuel lights been on for days  t mean anything  nother 500 miles    we shut it down                              re the coolest kids and we take what we can get  re young and in love  re young and in love  re young and in love  re young and in love  re young and in love   Jesse Lacey
