Well I talk Too much To myself And I turn my back on my faith s like glass When we Break I wish no one in my place ve seen t need their seeds When the cut goes in deep m lost in sleep t stay In this place t stand When the room turns round On my fate You give no guarantees s no promise I can keep t stand t see my way I feel blind On my feet t stay too long  lay the blame on luck  lay the blame on luck  lay the blame on luck  lay the blame on luck  lay the blame on luck  lay the blame on luck m so tired Of my mood And sleep comes  fork and a spoon re so pale In your face You let life Get in your way ve seen t need their seeds When the cut goes in deep m lost in sleep  lay the blame on luck  lay the blame on luck  lay the blame on luck  Timothy Butler
