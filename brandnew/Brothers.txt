s getting colder And the news keeps us scared We still wrestle this summer From the bones of our tired and blistered hands Cause tonight we got drinks And just a couple of friends And the girl that my brother likes is finally talking to him s proud and happy s got a great idea s making a memory Wake up and come out to the car s an east swell coming ll be Lying like lions out in the sands s hands So we make jokes back at home And we lighten the mood But growing up my parents saw What sending a kid to fight can really do re a little shook up s sons will never really be enough til half of our names are etched out in a wall And the other half ruined from the things we saw Wake up and come out to the car s an east swell coming ll be Lying like lions out in the sands s hands Wake up and come out to the car s an east swell coming ll be Lying like lions out in the sands
