 my darling cause we believe in everything re sure to drown So we strap ourselves up to this engine now  laying under the backseat re shouting so loud you barely enjoy this broken thing  is what I say You were freezing over hell  you do so well s what I say  think that will sort me and sweep me under the rug And a beating with a book everyone the book tells you to love There is an ember in the heart of the kiln And its burning hot with love s nothing but dust holding me with care into your cigarette Cause the God I believe in never worked on a campaign trail re shouting so loud you barely enjoy this broken thing  is what I say You were freezing over hell  you do so well s what I say re shouting so loud you barely enjoy this broken thing  is what I say You were freezing over hell  you do so well s what I say Feels like we could escape this I might throw it away for fear of the silver sun If you try running a maze of your lies  Jesse Lacey
