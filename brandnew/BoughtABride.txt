Trees will make a forest Trees will make a bow These are all the harder Words you have to know s a structure Where their own savior sits m a little red house s living in it Cars are little blood cells We are oxygen City is the airways Suburbs appendages She was feeling lonely So you let her hide Rented out a family We bought a bride Bought a bride Bought a bride Bought a bride Little cities names labeled along the map They tied her up and laid her on the train tracks Where are all the seedlings We grew from violence Down in Jersey lumber Stealing prosthetic limbs Should of been a soldier I could of fought and died s no revolution So I bought a bride Bought a bride Bought a bride Bought a bride They tied her up and laid her on the train tracks Somehow I always knew when everything was unsaid  Jesse Lacey
