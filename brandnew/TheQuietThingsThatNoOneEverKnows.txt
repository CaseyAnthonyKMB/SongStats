We saw the western coast I saw the hospital Nursed the shoreline like a wound s tryst Were neither clear nor descript We kept it safe and slow The quiet things that no one ever knows So keep the blood in your head And keep your feet on the ground s the day it gets tired s the day we drop out Gave up my body and bed All for an empty hotel Wasting words on lower cases and capitals I contemplate the day we wed Your friends are boring me to death Your veil is ruined in the rain s you I can do without s nothing new to talk about And though our kids are blessed Their parents let them shoulder all the blame So keep the blood in your head And keep your feet on the ground s the day it gets tired s the day we drop out Gave up my body and bed All for an empty hotel Wasting words on lower cases and capitals I lie for only you So keep the blood in your head And keep your feet on the ground s the day it gets tired s the day we drop out Gave up my body and bed All for an empty hotel  Jesse Lacey
