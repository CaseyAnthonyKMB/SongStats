So you tried to put a fire out But you used gasoline And when the congregation gathered round s a sickness that is going round s got a vaccine I think it drowned in holy water s time we all come clean s like dying To catch a ghost m trying To hold smoke s like dying To catch a ghost m trying To hold smoke When the army had to hold the line Well you were nowhere near the front Well you were loading up your gun ve left the great divide ve become You think that no one else is lonesome re the only one m jumping towards a train m jumping towards a train m trying to find a way m jumping towards a train m jumping towards a train  Vincent Accardi
