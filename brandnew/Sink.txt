t want to let you go But it hurts my hands to hold the rope t be such an easy mark re no better then they say And all the candles on the cake All set fire to the gate Turn the cannons towards the boat Men were drowning in the moat It was the end of all rowers oars m coming to get you  now m coming to get you m gonna let you s some earth and seed But only grow the things I need But first I must find my way back And you go lay down on the track At first I had an even keel s taken me this long to learn That every dead is ate by worms t return m coming to get you  now m coming to get you m gonna let you m coming to get you m coming to get you m coming to get you m gonna let you Then the fire snuck into your bedroom m falling asleep to forget you How darkly the dark hand met his end  exposed for a phoney But we heed the last words that he penned  Do not wait til later ve got to pretend I see God in birds and Satan in long words But I know what you need in a friend t see you How darkly the dark hand met his end  exposed for a phoney But we heed the last words that he penned  Do not wait til later m coming to get you  now m coming to get you m gonna let you m coming to get you  now m coming to get you m gonna let you Then the fire snuck into your bedroom  Jesse Lacey
