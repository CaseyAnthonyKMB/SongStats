 it is clear I am up to no good  letting this bed wetting cosmonaut ll realize t Just let me know ve been So drop me a line with a hook and some raw bleeding bait For I am uncaught and still swimming alone in the lake Shimmering under a moon made in anger and angst Shimmering like a penny out of reach in the subway grate t Just let me know ve been s someone who knows ve been You never worked well with our group Not with the faults we found So we fixed you with cement galoshes No one can save you now Unless you have friends among fish ll still be no air to breathe You could drink up the entire ocean ll never be t Just let me know ve been Or we could leave it alone s someone who knows  Jesse Lacey
