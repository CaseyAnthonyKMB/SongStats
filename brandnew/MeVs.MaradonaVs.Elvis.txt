With one or two I get used to the room We go slow when we first make our moves By five or six bring you out to the car Number nine with my head on the bar  but true s ve got desperate desires and unadmirable plans My tongue will taste of gin and malicious intent Bring you back to the bar Get you out of the cold  straight face gets you out of your clothes re scared that we know ll commit ll kiss before they get home I will lie awake Lie for fun and fake the way I hold you Let you fall for every empty word I say Barely conscious in the door where you stand Your eyes are fighting sleep as your mouth makes your demands You laugh at every word trying hard to be cute m going to do And your hair smells of smoke You can sin or spend the night all alone Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold In the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone ve thrown from the start ll tear you apart s all you can be re scared  all the girls drink for free I will lie awake And lie for fun and fake the way I hold you Let you fall for every empty word I say I will lie awake And lie for fun and fake the way I hold you Let you fall for every empty word I say I will lie awake And lie for fun and fake the way I hold you  Vincent Accardi
