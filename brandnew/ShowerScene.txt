s funny how your worst enemies always seem to  turn out to be all of your  s best friends  But I folded and I told  t things I saved to sink you   I told  So draw or throw and I will explode  s time for you to choose  the bullet or the chapstick  And you are far too cute or whatever he said  Every time I hear it I am wishing I was great   past tense my best friend  But I folded and I told  t things I say to save me   I told  s caught in the explosion  s time for you to choose  the bullet or the chapstick  And you are far too cute or whatever he said  s time for you to choose  s time for you to choose  the bullet or the chapstick  This is me in his room  This is me in his room  This is me in his room   I told  t play fair   I told  We never stand too close  So I update this almost every single day for you  I begin to hate you for your face and not just the things you do  Go tell him how my wrist is sore  from pulling at your insides all night   Garrett Tierney
