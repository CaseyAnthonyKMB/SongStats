Wait I watched you throw out your bouquet Now i think about you everyday m alone now in my bed s a lake ll find all my friends re all dead  or invent Cause I make little lies and then I pull them apart s living down in my heart And if I wanted to die before I got old ve started some years ago digging that hole Well I carry this box to the proper place And when I lower it down I let it you fade away I hope that you would do this for me d serve you drugs on a silver plate If I thought it would help you get away I hope that you would do this for me A deer that a hunter shot in the heart Some dogs that got hit by cars All came to spill their guts And we spoke  and Holy Ghost And which psalms we had loved the most And then we all turned to dirt And dust Some men die under the mountain just looking for gold Some die looking for a hand to hold Well I carry this box to its proper place And when I lower it down I let you fade away I hope that you would do this for me d serve you drugs on a silver plate If I thought it would help you get away I hope that you would do this for me m slowly bringing you down from the Heavenly gates m drowning in the flood I made Well explain myself to me on the other side ll watch from Heaven when I die Well I carry this box to the proper place And when I lower it down I let you fade away I hope that you would do this for me d serve you drugs on a silver plate If I thought it would help you get away  Jesse Lacey
