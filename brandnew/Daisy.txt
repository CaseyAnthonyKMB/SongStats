And we sing this morning  t know about you but I never get tired of it m a mountain that has been moved m a river that is all dried up m an ocean nothing floats on m a sky that nothing wants to fly in t burn hot s face t smile t finding anybody when he was on the shelf I saw him in my dream m a mountain that has been moved m a fugitive that has no legs to run m a preacher with no pulpit Well if we take all these things  and we bury them fast   to roots and then grass   Or if the sky opened up and started pouring rain Like he knew it was time  to start things over again   Well if we take all these things  and we bury them fast   to roots and then grass   d be easier that way Or if the sky opened up and started pouring rain Like he knew it was time  to start things over again    Vincent Accardi
