Last night they said the fire had spread  And we said our prayers t care We all go to sleep in the same place  re all the same Just sit around like broke down cars in the lot Waiting for repairs There you go Well I wish that I was as good as you  Caring and trusting m old and rusting So we just hurry up only to wait Add to the list of all the places we hate And I pretend like I got something to say ve got nothing Now I know that you stole Yeah you stole From the cradles they were rocked in You took the first words that they spoke Yeah you stole  Yeah you stole re a thief At least we both know where the other one sleeps s end this tonight Now I know that you stole  you stole From the cradles they were rocked in You took the first words that they spoke Yeah you stole Yeah you stole re a thief At least we both know where the other one sleeps  Jesse Lacey
